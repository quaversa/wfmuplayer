# wfmuplayer
Two methods to play wfmu streams and archives in the terminal. First one needs dialog and mpv. The second fzf, mpv, and the above wfmustrams url file. Both of these have next to no original code. The files contain links to the original scripts. All thanks to them, especially radio AB9IL who volunteered his fzf script, and thanks to WFMU!

To use, clone/download the directory and place wfmudialogplayer and wfmufzfplayer in your $PATH. Make them executable. Place wfmustreams in your home dirctory.
