# wfmuplayer
Two methods to play wfmu streams and archives in a linux terminal. First one needs dialog and mpv. The second fzf, mpv, and the wfmustrams file. Both have next to no original code. See files for links to the original makers. All glory to them, especially radio AB9IL who volunteered his fzf script. and glory glory to WFMU!

To use, clone/download the directory, place wfmudialogplayer and wfmufzfplayer in your $PATH and make them executable. Then drop the wfmuplayer folder in home/user/.cache/..
