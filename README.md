# wfmuplayer
A way to play wfmu streams and archives in a linux terminal. Needs fzf, mpv, and the wfmustrams file. It has next to no original code. See the script for links to the original maker radio AB9IL who volunteered up his fzf script when he saw my initial go at it. And even more thanks to WFMU.

The dead links in the archives will be nixed over time.

To use, clone/download the directory, place wfmufzfplayer in your $PATH and make them executable. Then drop the wfmuplayer folder in home/user/.cache/..
